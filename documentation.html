      <div class="title1">1. Dependences</div>
      <div class="text1">
      	This tool was developed based on two softwares, so it has some dependences. The first software 
      	is the Floodlight controller, which acts in the communication with switches and retrieves  
      	informations and statistics from them. So, OfMaT needs the Floodlight controller installed and 
      	running at network. More instructions about its instalation are available at developer page
      	(<a target="_blank" class="internal1" href="https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/display/floodlightcontroller">Floodlight Web Site</a>).
		<p>
      	The other software used in OfMaT was FlowVisor, a network hypervisor that slices the network resources
      	allowing multiple virtual networks running over the same physical infrastructure. OfMaT only needs 
      	this software if the network is sliced and its administrator wants to see information and statistics
      	about each slice. More instructions about its instalation are available at developer page
      	(<a target="_blank" class="internal1" href="https://github.com/OPENNETWORKINGLAB/flowvisor/wiki">FlowVisor 
      	Web Site</a>).
      	</p>
      </div>
      <div class="title1">2. OfMaT Configuration</div>
      <div class="text1">
      	Ofmat has a configuration file ("ofmat.conf") where are some parameters required for its operation.
      	The OfMaT modules uses the values from this file to get the device management information. Its 
      	content is organized according to the XML pattern as shown in the figure below.
      </div>	
      <div align="center"><img src="images/OfMaTconfigFile.jpg" height="170" width="333"></div>
	  
	  <div class="text1">
	    The file must always have in the first line the tag "&lt;ofmat&gt;" and its closing "&lt;/ofmat&gt;" should 
	    appear on the last line. In the other lines of the file, there may be several tags:

	  <span class="list_item">
	    <ul type="square">
	      <li>
	        <b>&lt;OFversion&gt;</b> (mandatory): specify the version of the OpenFlow protocol that is in use. 
	        Possible values are "1.0" or "1.3";
	      </li>
	      <li>
	      	<b>&lt;Virtualization&gt;</b> (mandatory): parameter used to indicate if all network resources 
	      	are being used in dedicated form (in this case the value is "No"), or if there is a slicing 
	      	of the resources from the existing physical network (in this case the value is "Yes");
	      </li>
	      <li>
	      	<b>&lt;NvMM&gt;</b>: this parameter is only required if the &lt;Virtualization&gt; tag has 
	      	the value "Yes". It will contain the necessary information so that the virtualization module
	      	(NvMM) can communicate with the network hypervisor. The informations must be specified using 
	      	the tags &lt;FVurl&gt;, &lt;FVuser&gt; and &lt;FVpassword&gt;, which provide, respectively, 
	      	the URL of the hypervisor, the user, and the password;
	      </li>
	      <li>
	      	<b>&lt;SwMM&gt;</b> (mandatory): contains the necessary information so that the switch module 
	      	(SWMM) can communicate with the controller responsible for providing the statistics of the 
	      	switches (Floodlight). Must be specified using the "&lt;url&gt;" tag, which will provide 
	      	the URL of this controller.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </span>

	    &nbsp;There is still a value restriction involving the parameters &lt;OFversion&gt; and 
	    &lt;Virtualization&gt;. As OfMaT currently only supports virtualization with version 1.0 of the 
	    OpenFlow protocol, the combination of &lt;Virtualization&gt; with the value "Yes" and 
	    &lt;OFversion&gt; with the value "1.3" is invalid and will be rejected by the script that does 
	    the validation of this configuration file.
	  </div>	  

      <div class="title1">3. <i>Switch View</i> Option</div>
      <div class="text1">
      	This option allows to get statistics and general information about switches in the network. 
      	When chosen, a select box appears containing all the active network switches. After selecting 
      	one of them, the information is shown arranged in 5 tables:

	  <span class="list_item">
	    <ul type="square">
	      <li>
	      	<b><i>Switch's Description:</i></b> it contains basic information about the switch, such as its 
	      	hardware and software, and the version of the OpenFlow protocol in use;
	      </li>
	      <li>
	      	<b><i>Switch's Features:</i></b> it provides information about some capabilities of 
	      	the switch, such as number of tables, buffers, supported actions and the role it 
	      	plays in the context of multiple controllers;
	      </li>
	      <li>
	      	<b><i>Switch's Ports:</i></b> it shows details of all ports on the switch, as its 
	      	hardware address and state;
	      </li>
	      <li>
	      	<b><i>Switch's Port Stats:</i></b> it provides statistics for each switch port: number 
	      	of collisions, transmitted and received packets, transmitted and received bytes, among others.
	      </li>
	      <li>
	      	<b><i>Switch's Flows:</i></b> it displays entire contents of the switch's flow table, 
	      	providing information such as flow's validity an its time of existence, OpenFlow version, 
	      	fields associated to the flow and their Match Values (conditions for a flow to be selected) 
	      	and the actions to be taken with them.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </span>      	
      &nbsp;The link "New Query", located after the last table, clears the current report and displays again  
      the list of existing switches, allowing that a new query be performed.
	  </div>	  
	  
      <div class="title1">4. <i>Slice View</i> Option</div>
      <div class="text1">
      	This option is available only to networks using virtualization. It provides information and 
      	statistics about network slices, as well as virtualized OpenFlow switches. This report is formed
      	by 4 tables:
	  <span class="list_item">
	    <ul type="square">
	      <li>
	      	<b><i>Slice's Information:</i></b> it shows some basic information about the network slice selected,
	      	such as its name, packet discard policy, controller URL and administrator's contact;
	      </li>
	      <li>
	      	<b><i>Slice's Switches:</i></b> it provides the list of switches belonging to the network
	      	slice selected, identified by the Data Path Identifier (DPID);
	      </li>
	      <li>
	      	<b><i>Slice's FlowSpace:</i></b> displays this network slice's FlowSpace, indicating for 
	      	each input the identifier (ID), name, switch's DPID, priority and match values;
	      </li>
	      <li>
	      	<b><i>Slice's Stats:</i></b> provides network slice's statistics, accounting the different 
	      	OpenFlow messages types on the network, which are grouped into: transmitted, received 
	      	and discarded.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </span>      	
      &nbsp;The link "New Query", located after the last table, clears the current report and displays again  
      the list of existing slices, allowing that a new query be performed.
